Follow these steps to create a new blog post:

1. **Draft the Content**: Identify the topic and key sections.
2. **Determine the Path**: Blog posts are stored in `src/content/blog/YYYY/MM/filename.md`. Use the current year and month. For example, for June 2026, it would be `src/content/blog/2026/06/`.
3. **Template**: Use the following structure, which adheres to the `blog` collection schema:

```markdown

pubDate: YYYY-MM-DD

4. **Instructions**:
   - **Do NOT create a Github issue or docs/issue or beads issue** for this workflow.
   - Set `draft: false` in the frontmatter.
   - Set `pubDate` to the current date (YYYY-MM-DD).
   - Create any necessary parent directories (e.g., the month folder).
   - **Images**: Run the `/blog-image` workflow to generate and save a hero image after the text is drafted.
   - **SEO & Quality**: Keep the description under 160 characters. Use semantic HTML headers (##, ###).
   - **LinkedIn**: Ensure `linkedinMessage` is drafted for social sharing. Optionally run `/evaluate-for-linkedin` later.
   - **Do not commit the change.**
