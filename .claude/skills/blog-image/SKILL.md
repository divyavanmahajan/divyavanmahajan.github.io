Follow these steps to generate and integrate a hero image for a blog post:

1. **Analyze Context**: Read the blog post's `title` and `description` from the frontmatter.
2. **Draft Prompt**: Create a prompt for `generate_image`. The style should be:
   - Clear, pastel colors.
   - Professional and easy to view.
   - Matches a modern, premium blog aesthetic.
   - Avoid generic or cluttered designs.
3. **Confirm with User**: Present the drafted prompt to the user and ask if they want any specific adjustments or if they are ready for generation.
4. **Generate**: Once confirmed, use `generate_image` to create the asset.
5. **Save Assets**:
   - Save the original image to `public/images/` with a slugified-filename-hero.png.
   - Create a secondary version with a **max 150px height** and save it to `public/images/icon/` with the same name.
6. **Update Post**:
   - Add the path to the `heroImage` field in the frontmatter (e.g., `heroImage: "/images/post-hero.png"`).
   - Do not insert any image markdown tag.

**Instructions**:
- **Do NOT create a Github issue or docs/issue or beads issue** for this workflow.
- **Do not commit the change.**
