description: Creates a new TIL (Today I Learned) post for this Astro blog. Use when the user wants to capture a short bite-sized learning.
---

Follow these steps to create a new TIL post:

1. **Draft the Content**: Identify the topic and what was learned.
2. **Determine the Path**: TILs are stored in `src/content/til/YYYY/MM/filename.md`. Use the current year and month. For example, for June 2026, it would be `src/content/til/2026/06/`.
3. **Template**: Use the following structure, inspired by existing TILs:

```markdown
---
title: "TITLE"
description: "DESCRIPTION"
pubDate: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
draft: false
---
